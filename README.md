# Fire-Detection-Using-Infrared-Images
Fire detection system has been developed using image processing technique which detect fire using camera in real time environment.  In this project, two method in GUI for input. 
First is video surveillance camera is recording real time video. (AForge a library has to be install for connect external camera in code.) The software application is getting the video and then segment into images. These images then filter, colours detect and motion detection gets high accuracy to detect fire. The project coded in AForge.net framework libraries. 
Second method is input IR video but it must be in .wmv format. 
In both method if fire detected then a message and sound is generated. 
Project stat in Microsoft visual studio 2013. The code starts via "cam_aforge1.csproj" file.
